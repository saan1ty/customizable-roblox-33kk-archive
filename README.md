To use this as a style on the Roblox website, use the "Stylish" extension found on the Google Web Store.
Once downloaded, click the icon in the extensions bar and navigate to the "Editor" tab.

Change the 'Domain' bar to be "roblox.com" if it is not already.
Then, copy and paste the contents of the attatched text file into the text box below the domain bar.
Save the extension, apply it, and reload your browser, and it should work correctly.

Please note that the customizations used here are ones that I chose, you will have to edit the code if you want to make any modifications.
